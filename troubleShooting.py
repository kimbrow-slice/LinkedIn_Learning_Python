#Errors tend to fall into 3 categories

#Syntax - Language rules broken
print(Hello World)
#No quotes

#Runtime - unable to execute
10 * (2/0)
#Zero division error (Undefined) If I don't understand the runtime error just look it up

#Semantic - unexpected output
name = "Alice"
print("Hello name") #prints Hello name
print("Hello" + " " + name) #prints Hello Alice
